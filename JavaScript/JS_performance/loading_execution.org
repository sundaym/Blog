** Loading & Execution
1. Keep in mind that browsers don't start rendering anything on the page until the opening <body> tag is encountered.
2. Putting script at the top of the page in this way typically leads to a noticeable delay.
3. Each file must wait until the previous one has been downloaded and executed before the next download can begin.
4. JS downloads still block downloading of other resources, such as images.
5. It's recommended to place all <script> tags as close to the bottom of the <body> tag as possible so as not to affect the download of the entire page.
